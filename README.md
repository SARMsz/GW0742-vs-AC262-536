<h1>GW0742 vs AC262,536 – My Real Test Results and Which One’s Worth It</h1>

<p>If you’ve used SARMs and PPAR agonists before, you’ve probably heard of <strong>GW0742</strong> and <strong>AC262,536</strong>. These are two very different compounds, but both caught my attention for cutting cycles and body recomposition. I ran both solo to see what they can actually do — no fluff, no hype, just results.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I only use Chemyo for these types of compounds because they provide real third-party testing and consistent dosing. If you want to run what I ran, use these:</p>

<h2>What Are These Compounds?</h2>

<h3>GW0742</h3>
<p>GW0742 is a PPARδ agonist — same family as GW501516 (Cardarine) but more selective. It helps boost endurance, fat loss, and energy metabolism. It’s not a SARM, but works great alongside SARMs or solo for cutting.</p>

<h3>AC262,536 (Accadrine)</h3>
<p>AC262,536 is a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM). It’s weaker than LGD or RAD, but comes with almost zero suppression. It’s a good choice for those who want lean gains, improved recovery, and vascularity without needing a full PCT.</p>

<h2>How I Tested GW0742 and AC262,536</h2>

<p>I ran each compound separately for 6 weeks. Kept diet strict (high protein, 20% deficit), trained 5 days/week. No other SARMs, no fat burners. Just these two, one at a time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>GW0742:</strong> 10mg/day for 6 weeks</li>
  <li><strong>AC262,536:</strong> 30mg/day for 6 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>Tracked endurance, fat loss, recovery, strength, energy, and any side effects.</p>

<h2>My Experience with GW0742</h2>

<p>I’ve used Cardarine before, and GW0742 feels like an upgrade in some ways. Within the first 7-10 days, my cardio shot up. I could push harder, longer, and recover faster between sets. It felt like I had an extra gear during workouts.</p>

<p>Fat started dropping by week 2. I lost about 4.5 lbs total over 6 weeks, and I stayed full and lean. Vascularity was sharp. No water retention at all. Best part? No crash, no shutdown, and no weird sides.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, endurance, fat loss</p>
<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 10mg/day</p>
<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GW0742 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clean fat loss</li>
  <li>Big endurance boost</li>
  <li>Zero suppression</li>
  <li>No liver stress or aggression</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>My Experience with AC262,536</h2>

<p>I ran AC262,536 solo after a break, and it gave me a nice lean-up and recovery boost. No bloat, no crash. Muscle looked fuller, recovery between workouts was better, and pumps were noticeable — especially arms and shoulders.</p>

<p>Fat loss wasn’t as fast as GW0742, but recomposition felt solid. I dropped 2 lbs, but looked leaner overall. Strength held steady and my mood stayed consistent the whole time.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Recomp, beginner-friendly lean cycles</p>
<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 30mg/day</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Very low suppression</li>
  <li>Solid for recomposition</li>
  <li>Improves recovery and gym performance</li>
  <li>No crash or aggression</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Slower results vs stronger SARMs</li>
  <li>Not ideal for bulking</li>
</ul>
